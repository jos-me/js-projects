All the project will be tested and the Javascript code will be executed in a browser enviroment. so,

- the basic knowledge of how browser work,

- Also, I will be using Boostrap CSS framework for styling my pages.

#### Configuring JS, CSS and Bootstrap files

The project starter folder will have all neccessary setup for next project, it will comprise of...

- The `custom CSS` (not sure to be used everywhere) for specific project will be found inside 'css' folder of the specific project directory.

The `minifies version of boostrap` will be found in a separate folder inside the main directory so to make it easy accessible to all project.
