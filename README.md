The project starter folder will have all neccessary setup for next project, it will comprise of...

- The `custom CSS` (not sure to be used everywhere) for specific project will be found inside 'css' folder of the specific project directory.

The `minifies version of boostrap` will be found in a separate folder inside the main directory so to make it easy accessible to all project.
